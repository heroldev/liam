A package of Liam Seper's algorithms, written and implemented in Golang.

# Usage
```import "github.com/heroldev/liam```

## LiamSort
LiamSort assumes the array is already sorted, and returns the unaltered array back. Runs in constant time.

## LiamSearch
LiamSearch assumes the item you are searching for is automatically not in the list, and returns back both -1 and nil. Runs in constant time.
